Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1
============================================

These are the files for Course Project 1 from the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis course.  There are four R scripts and four png files showing the results of those scripts.   The data is from the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  The scripts take the data from 2007/02/01 and 2007/02/02; they assume that the data is in the same directory as the scripts.

Plot 1
------

This is a histogram showing the frequency of the values of the Global Active Power in kilowats.

Plot 2
------

This is a line plot of the Global Active Power in kilowatts by time of day.

Plot 3
------

This is a line plot with three lines representing the submetering 1, 2, and 3 (kitchen, laundry room, and electric water heater/air conditioner) in 
watt-hours of active energy versus time.

Plot 4
------

This is four line plots representing global active power versus time (Plot 1), voltage used versus time, energy submetering versus time (Plot 3), and global reactive power versus time.
